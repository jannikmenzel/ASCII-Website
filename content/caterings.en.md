# Caterings

Still missing the right catering for your event? We are happy to support you. In addition to our regular café service, we offer a flexible catering service for university and student events, meetings, workshops, or celebrations – exclusively on the campus of the Technische Universität Dresden.

Our offering includes freshly prepared sandwiches, pretzels with butter, cakes, and savory snacks. We also provide a selection of beverages, including coffee, tea, water, juices, soft drinks, and, upon request, mate refreshment drinks.

We focus on simple organization, reliable delivery, and catering that works without much effort. Just tell us your needs, date, and approximate number of participants, and we will put together a suitable offer.

Simply send us an email at: caterings@ascii-dresden.de
