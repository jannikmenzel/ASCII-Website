### General Information on the Legal Bases of Data Processing on this Website

If you have given consent to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR
or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR if special categories of data according to Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR are processed. In the case
of an explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also carried out on the
basis of Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to access information on your
device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), data processing is also based on § 25 para. 1 TTDSG. Consent can be revoked at

### Recipients of Personal Data

In the course of our business activities, we work with various external parties. Sometimes the transfer of personal data
to these external parties is necessary. We only pass on personal data to external parties if this is necessary for
contract fulfillment, if we are legally obligated to do so (e.g., passing data to tax authorities), if we have a
legitimate interest according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR in the disclosure, or if another legal basis permits the
data disclosure. When using processors, we only pass on personal data of our customers on the basis of a valid contract
for order processing. In the case of joint processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.

### Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing

Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent already given at any
time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.

### Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct Advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)

IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6 PARA. 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT AT ANY TIME TO OBJECT TO THE
PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING
BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. YOU CAN FIND THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.
IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR
THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR THE PROCESSING SERVES THE ASSERTION, EXERCISE OR
DEFENSE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21 PARA. 1 GDPR).

IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE
PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS

PURPOSES (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21 PARA. 2 GDPR).

### Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority

In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority,
in particular in the member state of their habitual residence, place of work, or the place of the alleged infringement.
The right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.

### Right to Data Portability

You have the right to receive data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a
contract in a commonly used, machine-readable format and to have it transmitted to yourself or to a third party. If you
request the direct transfer of data to another controller, this will only be done insofar as it is technically feasible.

### Information, Correction, and Deletion

You have the right at any time under the applicable legal provisions to receive free information about your stored
personal data, its origin and recipients, and the purpose of data processing as well as the right to correction or
deletion of this data. For this and other questions regarding personal data, you can contact us at any time.

### Right to Restriction of Processing

You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any time
for this purpose. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:

- If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored with us, we usually need time to verify this. During the
  verification period, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.

- If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request restriction of data processing instead of
  deletion.

- If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend, or assert legal claims, you have the
  right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.

- If you have filed an objection according to Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR, a balancing of interests must be made between your
  interests and ours. As long as it is not yet clear whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the
  restriction of the processing of your personal data.

If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data – apart from their storage – may only be
processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the
rights of another natural or legal person or for important public interest reasons of the European Union or a member
state.
